# Blurtz

Real-time card game based on Nertz. Currently my playground for full stack application development, trying out new technologies, and improving on egregious vibe-coding practices.

## Stack

**Client:** React + Tailwind CSS, Vite for dev/tooling, Zustand for state management

**Server:** NestJS, Prisma (ORM + PostgreSQL), Redis + Socket.IO

## Development

```bash
make up    # Start services
make down  # Stop services
```

Client runs on `:3030`, server on `:3031`.
